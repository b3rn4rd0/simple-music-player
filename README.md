# simple-music-player
It's a music player made in Python, a small project for college.
I use the library Tkinter for the interface of my project;
I use the library Pygame because it has the modules to control the streamed audio;
My music player only play the songs that you choose, if you have a file of a song, you must to search in your computer while the project is working, then, chose it to play.
